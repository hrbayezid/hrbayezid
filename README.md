### 🧠 About Me

Hey there! I'm Bayezid — an aspiring data scientist from Sylhet, Bangladesh, building the skills to solve real-world problems with Python, machine learning, and a sprinkle of visualization magic.

I love turning messy data into clean insights and making models that actually *do stuff*, not just sit around collecting dust like old math books.
